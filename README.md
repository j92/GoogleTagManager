Google Tag Manager
==================

This extension inserts the Google Tag Manager code in your pages. Edit the `config.yml` file so
it contains the correct 'gtm_container_id'.

Missing features
----------------

These are features I didn't need yet so didn't provide yet. You could add them and open a PR.
In my opinion, as long as nobody needs this it's just featuritis to add them.

You could add a Google Analytics code with Tag Manager, so it could be nice if this plugin also
provided an optional widget for Google Analytics.

There is no support for the Google Tag Manager data layer. A service should be made so you can
push variables to the data layer from anywhere. Also a Twig extension for this would be nice.
